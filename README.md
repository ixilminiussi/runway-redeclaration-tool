*This application was done in the context of a group second year project alongside 3 other students. It is being published here for the purpose of logging all projects I have worked on, but I am not the sole owner or writer of this code.*

*The task was to apply agile methodology and teamwork to make a runway redeclaration tool per the specifications of a fictional client. The finale product is demonstrated [here](https://bit.ly/3z3HtZm).*

# Group 44 Runway Re-declaration Tool
